# Machine-Learning-Project
Example of an analysis of two protein datasets. The code contains: data visualisation (low dimensional embedding), unsupervised and supervised methods (clustering and classification), generative modelling (statistical inference).
I was given two files: the former contains 1130 sequences of natural proteins in multiple sequence alignment. Each protein in composed by 96 amino acids and each amino acid can be one of the 20 characters {A,C,...,Y} but also an alignment gap {-}. Each of the natural sequences has been tested to be "functional" or "non-functional" given certain biological conditions experimentally measured. The second file contains 1003 artificial sequences, i.e. sequences that were sampled (not given how) from the probability distribution of the natural ones: also each of the artificial sequences were provided with labels functional-nonfunctional, tested in the lab.
The objective of this code is to first visualise the datasets through some simple dimensional reduction, both linear (PCA) and non-linear (t-sne and UMAP). Then, some unsupervised techniques are applyed (kmeans clustering, DBSCAN) and some supervised ones are taken into account for predicting the functionality of proteins (logistic regression, random forest, adaboost). Finally, generative models are taken into play for infering and generating new sequences from the pdf of the natural ones (Boltzmann machine learning).
